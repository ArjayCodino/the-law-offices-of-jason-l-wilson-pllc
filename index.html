                        <p style="text-align: justify;font-size: 17px;padding-top: 10%;padding-left: 1%;">To be eligible for disability benefits, it is crucial to understand and fulfill the requirements and deadlines without delay. Alongside gathering and submitting all necessary medical evidence, having an attorney who understands how disability insurance works can make a significant difference in the outcome of your claim.  <br>
                        <br>
                        The Supplemental Security Income (SSI) and Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) programs are administered by the Social Security Administration (SSA) through its Disability Determination Services (DDS). It is important to file paperwork correctly, provide complete medical records that support your medical condition, and meet all deadlines.</p>

                    <h3>What are the Requirements?</h3>
                    <p>To receive disability benefits, you must have a medical condition that prevents you from working and meet the SSA's list of impairments. If not listed, you must demonstrate the severity of your condition. You must also have worked long enough to qualify. A skilled attorney can assist with the claims process and medical evidence collection. <br>
                    <br>
                    </p><h3>SSI vs SSDI</h3>
                    <p>Supplemental Security Income (SSI) and Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) are two types of disability programs that provide financial assistance to individuals with disabilities. While SSI is based on financial need, SSDI is based on work history and contributions to the Social Security system, including social security taxes paid by workers. An applicant needs a social security number and enough years' worth of social security taxes paid to be eligible for SSDI benefits. In contrast, the eligibility for SSI depends on medical eligibility along with an individual's income and resources. With the help of an experienced attorney, a claimant can navigate the application process for both programs easily.
